# Mental Health Chatbot

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The project aims to develop a chatbot that can help individuals dealing with mental health issues. The chatbot will provide support and guidance to users who may be struggling with anxiety, depression, or any other mental health disorder. The chatbot will use natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to offer personalized support to the users. 


## Background

Mental health issues are a widespread problem worldwide, and many individuals suffer from various mental health disorders. According to the World Health Organization, one in four people globally will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives. The stigma associated with mental health issues is a significant barrier to people seeking help.

The chatbot aims to help individuals overcome this barrier by providing them with a safe and secure space to discuss their issues without fear of judgment. The chatbot will use natural language processing to understand the user's messages and offer appropriate support based on their symptoms.


## How is it used?
Users can access the chatbot through various platforms like web, mobile, or social media. The chatbot will use conversational AI to interact with users and provide them with personalized support. The chatbot will ask the user a series of questions to understand their symptoms and suggest appropriate coping mechanisms. The chatbot will also be able to offer emergency assistance in case of a crisis.

## Data sources and AI methods
The chatbot will use various data sources to provide support to users. The chatbot will use NLP algorithms to understand the user's messages and offer appropriate support based on their symptoms. The chatbot will also use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in user behavior and provide more personalized support.

## Challenges

The chatbot will face many challenges, including ethical considerations like data privacy and security. The chatbot must also be culturally sensitive and provide support that aligns with the user's cultural and social norms.

## What next?

The chatbot can grow and become something more by adding new features like video support or integrating with other mental health resources like hotlines. The project will require additional resources like data scientists, psychologists, and software developers to create a robust and reliable chatbot.


## Acknowledgments
